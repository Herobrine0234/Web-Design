<h2>The Micro Bit (also referred to as BBC Micro Bit, stylized as micro:bit) is an open source hardware ARM-based embedded system designed by the BBC for use in computer education in the UK. It was first announced on the launch of BBC's Make It Digital campaign on 12 March 2015 with the intent of delivering 1 million devices to pupils in the UK. The final device design and features were unveiled on 6 July 2015 whereas actual delivery of devices, after some delay, began in February 2016.</h2>

<p>The microbit challenges were designed to test our critical thinking and problem solving skills.
Creating code together with my partner to make patterns and power machines. It was a great experience 
and a lot of fun. I hope to do more exiciting and challenging tasks in the future.</p>
